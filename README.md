### Research
1. Compare pre- and in-operation reaction times to determine significance
2. Determine wakefulness of the patient.
3. How quickly the patient is expected to be awake.
4. Find out the optimal time period of wakefulness.
5. Find out if there is a correlation to the EEG value.

The Reaction-Test provides data which is needed for the research.

### How to evaluate statistics
In order to get the most of the data, Bayesian Statistics could make the difference.
